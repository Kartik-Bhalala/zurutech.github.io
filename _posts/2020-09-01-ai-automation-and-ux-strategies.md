AI and automation have become such popular terms in the world of tech that they need little introduction. Driven by the same goals - making our lives easier, taking care of the repetitive tasks, and freeing up our mind for the most creative tasks - they have allowed huge advancements in our lives. 

However, it is useful to remember that they are based on different principles. On the one hand, automation responds to a carefully designed algorithm that is triggered by specific actions. On the other hand, AI anticipates specific actions thanks to patterns it assimilates; the more time and data the more it can improve and replace human thinking in certain aspects of work or life.

At Zuru Tech, both these forms of technology are used to create a BIM software that aims at making house design easy and pleasant for everyone, without neglecting the technical precision needed to deliver projects that can have an immediate implementation and without risking to overlook factory requirements. 

But what are the challenges of creating optimal user experiences that make the most of these two technologies and serve the right purpose? In the Design Team at Zuru Tech we have to consider all this when designing user interactions. 

Here are the principles we apply to make sure that what we design makes sense for the users. 
<br>
<br>

## 1. Do not work in a bubble

Communication is key. You will hear it often and it could not be truer. 

When dealing with highly specialized contexts, UX designers need to find ways to make up for the lack of technical knowledge. 
It does not mean that you need to become an architect or a civil engineer, but it does mean that you need to engage in conversations with professionals that form part of your user group, and listen in order to understand what they are trying to achieve and what limitations they work with. 

Luckily for us, the design team at Zuru works in close contact with architects and engineers, so we make sure to keep the conversation going and review our mockups and user flows with the people for whom the software is meant.

## 2. Let users choose

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Anyone who has ever used a BIM software will know that they are rich in tools that allow users to design with a high level of detail and creativity. Automation and AI can come in handy to support the users during the design phase: the automatic creation of interconnected elements, for example, can facilitate completion of the more tedious tasks, whereas alerts and suggestions can help the user avoid mistakes. 

In the case of the Zuru Tech software, there are also factory requirements that will create a preferential path towards which the user’s actions will be guided. But during the design phase, we also have to take into account different ways of using the software, cases where the ideal scenario (the <i>happy path</i>) will only be partially met. 

How do you design for those cases? How do you allow the expert user - the highly skilled professional - to still have the freedom to work as they wish and not feel as if the software wants to “teach” them how to do their job, or even force them in a predetermined direction? In short, how do you make sure the software has a high level of adaptability to the user’s needs?

For us, it means giving users choice. For example, users will be able to modify certain automatically created elements and dismiss suggestions that are not in line with what they have set to achieve, as long as the implications are clear (very important!).

<br>

## 3. Use visual cues

<br>

<br>
<br>

Great help in finding the right balance - between showing suggestions that are not overwhelming and making sure the directions are clear - comes from the world of video game design with the use of visual cues. They can take the form of a highlight in a different colour to signal an error, a change in the size of an element that can be modified, or a display on hover of an additional function. 

In our case, these strategies work as signifiers for automation algorithms and AI suggestions guided by the rules of architectural design. They help the users discover and learn how to use the various tools of the BIM software interface in a way that is fun and engaging.
<br>
<br>

## Conclusions

In conclusion, even though AI and automation are made to simplify our lives, it does not mean their implementation is always straightforward for the users. They have to be carefully studied and adapted with the right amount of signifiers. These signifiers sometimes can come from different fields, like video gamedesign, for example, so as designers keeping an open mind is crucial to find the right solution.
