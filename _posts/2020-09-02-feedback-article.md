## What is a Feedback?<br>
Feedbacks occurs when an environment reacts to an action or behavior.
Every day in our life we giving and receiving feedbacks: we say hello to a friend we meet, we become happy by watching a comedy, and we are upset if we enter an examination room. Emotional reactions underlie the concept of feedback.

In a company environment, A feedback turn to the process that describes how the result of a task performed by a person is reflecting on that person, in order to suggest how to correct and/or improve itself.

Basically a Feedback can be splitted into three meaningful stages:

- Reflection: Focused on what you have reached until today; 
- Goal Setting: Focused on what you want to achieve tomorrow;
- Feedforward: Focused to the actions to perform based on the previous ones;
<br> 

## Why feedbacks are so important?<br> 
The Feedback is an asset for companies and its workers, because it allows to create a “communication channel” between the people, encourage collaboration, team building and providing guidelines from both sides at “zero cost”, with mutual benefits for a profitable working relationship.

From the employer's perspective allow to understand the employees needs, the improvement areas and a general monitoring of their work-force. 
For some companies, this aspect can be evaluated as time waste; instead, be aware about this status means to be interested in company performance and how to improve it.
From the employees perspective, it allows a personal and professional growth, by understanding which corrections perform along their job’s journey.

Lack of feedback suggests disinterest and often it’s the root cause of a lose-lose scenario; a very common and uncontrolled feed-forward is the quit of the employees.
