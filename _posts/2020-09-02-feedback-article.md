## What is Feedback?<br>
Feedbacks occurs when an environment reacts to an action or behaviour. Every day in our life we giving and receiving feedbacks: we say hello to a friend we meet, we become happy by watching a comedy, and we are upset if we enter an examination room. Emotional reactions underlie the concept of feedback.
In a company environment, A feedback turns to the process that describes how the result of a task performed by a person is reflecting on that person, to suggest how to correct and/or improve itself.

Feedback can be split into three meaningful stages:
Reflection: Focused on what you have reached until today;
Goal Setting: Focused on what you want to achieve tomorrow;
Feedforward: Focused on the actions to perform based on the previous ones.
<br> 

## Why feedbacks are so important?<br> 
The Feedback is an asset for companies and its workers because it allows to create a “communication channel” between the people, encourage collaboration, transparency, build loyalty. From the employer's perspective allow understanding the employees needs, the improvement areas and general monitoring of their work-force. For some companies, this aspect can be evaluated as time waste; instead, be aware of this status means to be interested in company performance and how to improve it.
From the employees perspective, it allows a personal and professional growth, by understanding which corrections perform along their job’s journey. Lack of feedback suggests disinterest and often it’s the root cause of a lose-lose scenario; a very common and uncontrolled feed-forward is the quit of the employees.

## The characteristics of a good feedback<br>
