Welcome to the third article in the series! In this article, I will focus on how each skill can be useful to boost other skills.

In the image on the right, you will see every skill we talk about until now: the leader's foundation.
If you have all the skills mentioned until now, sure you will be a good leader, but if you have the ones listed below, you will be an excellent team leader!
So let's look at how different skills can support each other or how they originate new skills!

## Conclusions

In this image, you can see a small recap of what I've explained with this article, and that's all I had to say about the skills that can make an excellent leader. Now, how will we find and create a new technical leader and a leader for your company?
First, you hire a person or look for an employee in your company who fits the skill set to a reasonable degree. Second, you check if he can bring something new to the table (new energy, new passion, one of the soft skills in the image above that is more developed than anyone else in your technical leaders' team). And, third, you test him on the field.

How do you test him on the field? You place him side-by-side with one of your leaders. You gradually give to your trainee more responsibility, and you gradually introduce him to all the decision processes a technical leader in your company goes through when he works.

And that's everything for this article, in the next article we will build on these conclusions, and we will see how to train a new team leader, how to create a training program and how to evaluate your trainee training period.
