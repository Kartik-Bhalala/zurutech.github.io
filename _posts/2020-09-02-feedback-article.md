## Why feedbacks are so important?<br> 
The Feedback is an asset for companies and its workers, because it allows to create a “communication channel” between the people, encourage collaboration, team building and providing guidelines from both sides at “zero cost”, with mutual benefits for a profitable working relationship.

From the employer's perspective allow to understand the employees needs, the improvement areas and a general monitoring of their work-force. 
For some companies, this aspect can be evaluated as time waste; instead, be aware about this status means to be interested in company performance and how to improve it.
From the employees perspective, it allows a personal and professional growth, by understanding which corrections perform along their job’s journey.

Lack of feedback suggests disinterest and often it’s the root cause of a lose-lose scenario; a very common and uncontrolled feed-forward is the quit of the employees.
