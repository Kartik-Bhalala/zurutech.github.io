## INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS THE FEEDBACK?
....

The feedback is the process that describes how the result of a task performed by a person is reflecting on that person, in order to correct/improve itself.
 
Provide feedback is a crucial aspect for companies and its workers, because it allows to create a “communication channel” between the people, encourage collaboration, team building and providing guidelines from both sides at “zero cost”.


## PAR1

A profitable feedback should have:
- No Prejudices, likings and free from personal involvement;
- Planned frequently;
- Respect and Openness;
- Positive or Negative;
- Must includes suggestions;
- Bidirectional


## PAR2

....

## Conclusions

In Zuru Tech Italy, this aspect is really considered; the company is aware about the benefits of mutual and constant feeds, by removing hierarchical barriers, planning frequent meetings with these aims and encouraging people to be open and feel free to discuss frequently.
